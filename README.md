# AirBnB-Sentiment-Analysis
This report presents an unsupervised topic modelling analysis of customer reviews from Airbnb listings, with the goal of identifying frequently discussed themes and providing data-driven recommendations to enhance business performance. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), we processed and analyzed textual feedback to extract six dominant topics across thousands of guest reviews.

To ensure clarity and focus, text data was preprocessed by removing irrelevant elements such as punctuation and stopwords, and only meaningful words were retained for analysis. Due to the execution environment limitations, part-of-speech tagging was omitted; however, the results still provide strong insights into guest priorities and pain points.

The model revealed recurring topics that centered around comfort and sleep quality, host communication, cleanliness of the bathroom, property location, kitchen amenities, and price-related perceptions. These topics were consistent with known factors that influence customer satisfaction in the accommodation industry.

The results highlight specific areas for improvement:

* Enhancing bedding and sleep comfort

* Improving host responsiveness and guest onboarding

* Maintaining high standards of cleanliness

* Providing accurate descriptions of property location

* Upgrading essential amenities (e.g., kitchen, bathrooms)

* Ensuring pricing reflects the quality offered

By addressing these critical guest concerns, Airbnb hosts can significantly improve the overall guest experience, increase positive reviews, and drive repeat bookings. Topic modelling has proven to be an effective tool for summarizing large volumes of unstructured feedback into actionable insights that align with strategic business priorities.
